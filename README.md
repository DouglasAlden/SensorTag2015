# SensorTag2015

This is a couple of python scripts to interface a TI SensorTag 2015 to a Raspberry Pi.  I made some minor edits to previous work by https://github.com/tacker66/pihome.  This work also was developed with insights taken from https://github.com/msaunby/ble-sensor-pi

The SensorTag 2015 has different sensors than the original SensorTag.  The Multi-Standard CC2650 SensorTag Design Guide can be found here: http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu862/tidu862.pdf

For the time being I really only need the T, RH and lux sensors.  As I find time and get the requisite info from TI I will add the other sensors.
